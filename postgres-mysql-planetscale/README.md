# Postgres -> MySQL -> PlanetScale Import

This script leverages [AWS DMS](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) to migrate an existing Postgres source database to PlanetScale using an additional Amazon MySQL database.

Refer to the [PlanetScale docs](https://planetscale.com/docs/imports/postgres-mysql-planetscale-migration-guide) for a guide on how to use these scripts.
